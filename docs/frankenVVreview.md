#Frankenstein Variorum Review

This page is a review/critique of the (Digital Frankenstein Variorum)[https://frankensteinvariorum.github.io/viewer/], which collects editions of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein and compares moments of change between each edition for users to experience.

###Interesting Discovery Moments

Reading the 10 sections using the 1818 edition of Frankenstein as the default, I found it fascinating and extremely 
curious how Mary Shelley changed entire narratives of characters between this edition and the 1831 & Thomas editions. 
There is one such passage in section 6 that, in the 1818 version, is comprised of only 3 sentences. In that small passage, 
Victor writes to his sister of how the stranger he had rescued from the arctic began talking to him about his endeavors. 
All that Mary Shelley includes is that the stranger gives Victor good advice, and Victor perceives him as a very amicable and compassionate person. 
Meanwhile, in the 1831 edition, this brief description of the characters’ budding connection is super-imposed into four entire lengthy paragraphs, 
containing new dialogue and a much deeper read into the stranger’s character, his woes, and his deep connection & sympathies with Victor. This lengthy and revealing expansion
of the passage from the 1818 and 1823 editions in the 1831 edition adds a whole new layer of intrigue and mystery onto readers’ perspective of the stranger.

There were so many other interesting differences between the Thomas edition and the others, but this one from the 1831 edition was undeniably significant: 
in section 7, before the 6th paragraph in the 1818 edition (beginning with “When my father became a husband and a parent...”), Mary Shelley inserted an extremely 
thorough background narrative to Victor’s parents, how they met and fell in love, their tender and loving parenting throughout Victor’s childhood, and the story of how 
his parents found his sister Elizabeth and adopted her from a poor family in Italy – all in the 1831 edition. Omitting that whole background, I suppose you still gather 
the understanding of the narrator’s deep love he has for his parents and his sister in the editions before 1831, but by adding this touching background into Victor’s parents’ 
and sister’s pasts, Mary Shelley paints a much more vivid picture of the connections between these characters, and adds a more powerful bond between reader and character, 
allowing readers to envision these characters and their pasts in much deeper detail – like she did with the passage I mentioned above with the stranger on the boat.

There are some smaller yet still interesting changes that change the tone and the way information is perceived by the reader – one being a passage in section 3 where Robert 
is writing to his sister about a seaman on board with him, who once tried to convince his ex’s father to let her be with her desired lover instead. Robert tells his sister 
in the letter that while the man’s actions were noble, he isn’t educated much, and doesn’t have many inclinations beyond being a sailor. In the 1818, 1823, and Thomas editions, 
all that is written is that he “doesn’t have much of an idea beyond the rope and shroud,” while in the 1831 edition, he writes instead that he is “wholly uneducated,” and his air 
of ignorant carelessness sort of detracts from his capacity to be fully sympathized with. This change, while somewhat minor, totally changes the way the reader perceives Robert’s 
perception of the sailor. The 1831 edition sort of reflects a different attitude towards the sailor within Robert, while the other editions seem to mention the fact of his lack 
of education in mere passing. The tone of this detail shifts quite a bit between the two versions – and I’ve noticed many other instances where different editions reflect minor 
tone changes like this as well.

It seems, from the Thomas Copy edition to the 1831 edition, many of the strike-throughs, insertions, deletions, and substitutions that Mary Shelley made by hand 
in the Thomas copy were reflected almost exactly as corrections in her 1831 edition. You can especially see evidence of this in section 7, where in all of the other 
editions the passage in the screenshot below is included in some form – in the Thomas copy, she crossed the whole thing out – and then in the 1831 edition, the passage 
she struck through has been omitted.
