## Game 1: "Sand: A Superfluous Game" Analysis - First Notes

*Sand* betrays its self-description of being superfluous - it gives you just the right amount of world exploration, intriguing storyline, and infinitely fun mechanics - but *not enough game.* This is no fault of the game designers of course, because the game simply isn't finished - there are only a couple of (VERY fun and exciting) missions currently written into the game, and the last mission doesn't give players any sort of conclusion whatsoever. As I dive into this review, I will be furthering my angsty and lustful desire to get my hands on the rest of this lovely little game.

**World-Building Graphics and Media**

"Sand" has sooooo much potential to delve deeper into the exploratory features of the virtual apocalyptic dystopia! Even in the (so far) limited range of the map, the player is sucked into this sparse, mutated and enthralling world of post-apocalyptic Alaska. (which, by the way, is hilarious that they decided on Alaska as the setting of this desert wasteland!) Not only do you get to rebuild and create your own home base with tons of unlockable building tools, livestock, and technology - you can go off from the limits of your base square and explore into nearby units, whether they are empty and full of "skellies" or mission-based neighboring towns or inhabited places. The graphics, from a superficial standpoint, are very basic - but it makes a great 8-bit aesthetic of the game, and the simplicity of the graphics do not at all reflect the complexity of the game mechanics. The survival features of exploring the wasteland, scavenging for resources, making trades by doing tasks for neighbors, and especially the enemies that either periodically raid your base or the ones you encounter whilst exploring or completing missions is extremely intriguing and addicting. 

**Settings and Ability to Manipulate Them**

The settings, it terms of how much the player can manipulate the surroundings, are super complex. There's so much you can do with ranching, farming, and especially technology that is actually mind-blowing for how simple this game appears at first. You can ride llamas, build energy-producing transformers and other means of energy production to not only produce goods, but also for self-defense (the automated gun turrets and electric-powered gate mechanisms are WICKED). You can literally personalize your whole base, and it's quite easy to learn by going through the missions and visiting neighboring locations. I also loved how you could buy a "player upgrades" asset that would allow you to upgrade your player's heath, stamina, "canteen" for traveling father distances, and so much more. You can even design the look of your own character with a Mirror and Dresser!

**Player and Non-Player Character Control**

You only really "control" yourself, in terms of mobility, but as you build and expand your base you are able to build more houses (or anything, really) and build beds so that more people come to work on your base. You can see how many people are living on your base on the left inventory bar. You can then build a job board, through which you can assign your "minions" different jobs to do on your base so that they will farm, ranch, clean, and even guard your base for you. So in that way, you can control them. You can also ride a llama around which makes travel much faster! And, as you progress in the story and complete missions, you can collect travelling buddies that will come with you to stay at your base, and unlike the other villiagers at your base, you can right-click on them and they will join you to travel into other plot units outside of your home! So far, they only have so many missions implemented, and by the time I finished all of the missions you accrued two traveling-mates. Also, you get a cute doggo that follows you around and barks at enemies who are attacking you, which is a super sweet touch. :)

**Narrative-Driver: E.D.I.E.**

As the game progresses and you complete missions, your character and the characters you interact with engage in riveting dialogue. First, you meet E.D.I.E., which is a cube AI which crash-landed from space onto some poor guy - and E.D.I.E. is hilarious. He keeps having these little slip-ups as it talks to you about its mission to save the world, in which you must be the primary perpetuator (only since E.D.I.E. lacks mobility structures), but quite often it will refer to you as it's minion. The player responds in this dialogue, skeptically noting on E.D.I.E.'s sketchy verbal accidents while also taking orders from it.

**NPC Characters**

You have the mission NPC characters, which engage you in riveting and quirky dialogue and give you tasks for rewards, you have your NPC camp-mates (a.k.a. slaves/minions as E.D.I.E. calls them) which you can direct to do various jobs on your home base, you have NPCs that will accompany you off your home base and help you pillage/raid other map units, those of which you have to acquire through completing a mission, and then you have enemies - which can come in the form of roaches, crab-like things, skellies, snakes, or raiders. They will periodically come in mobs to raid your home base unless you and your camp-mates kill them, and they also appear in non-location wasteland units - increasing in strength and difficulty to defeat as you get further away from your home base.

**Challenges and Missions**

The biggest challenged are basically creating enough things to build up your inventory stocks more and more to upgrade yourself and your base, which can ultimately help you complete missions faster and easier as well. A huge struggle at the beginning of the game for me was, whenever I was out exploring and I found all kinds of neat raw materials to bring back home, I was attacked by horrendous monsters and killed. Once you die outside of your home, you are sent back home and all of your hard-earned materials you've found while out exploring have vanished! D: 
The missions are SO fun because you basically get to meet new and interesting characters, and complete more and more challenging tasks for them in order to get to new places in the game map, and to acquire more raw materials (or "scrap", which is currency in Sand).

**Object Interactions and Building**

This game reminds me a lot of Minecraft in many ways - you harvest various raw materials to make more buildings, more production technology, and ultimately anything else to make your homebase more self-sufficient. Once you build certain objects, some give you the option of interacting with them - like for Ranching, you can interact with Chickens by hugging them and they'll produce an egg, which gives you meat to sell (after you hug it enough to make an egg, the interaction changes to "kick" which is kind of awful and hilarious) - you can mount Llamas to travel to places outside of your home base much faster, you and your camp-mates can heal using the Veggie Pot (which requires Veggies to be used - you must farm veggies using Veggie Plots made of dirt) after defeating raiding miscreants in battle, and of course you can craft various weapons and tools which appear in your inventory to use either in battle or in everyday chores. In short, you can interact with almost anything you build that isn't just a structure-building material. You can also create machines which churn out Energy by harnessing either Oil, sunlight, or the wind (yes there's weather and day/night times in the game which is rad), and once you have energy you can create Transformers and Relays which can power switch-operated mechanisms to do all kinds of neat-o things.

**Meta-References; Breaking the 4th Wall**

There are lots of funny little references to "He Who Codes" sort of as a god-like figure, who controls the will of the people of this wasteland.

There are also lots of funny references to the human-operated controls within character dialogue:

**Game Comments on Real-World Reality**

Oh man, the whole setting and context of the gameplay is based on a dystopian future of our world! You're literally a survivor of an Alaskan apocalypse. There are so many bits of dark humor sewed into the dialogue of the characters which adorably yet also eerily reflect real people and human behavior. One glaring metaphor I noticed was a bit of dialogue between the Player (me) and Mayor Pete in Anchor Rage, as Mayor Pete politicks about his political agenda to keep all the scary non-humans out of the town with a **hyuge** wall:
![is_this_a_trump_joke](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70165410/100648802-78413f00-330f-11eb-982f-a61eac6a67a5.png)
 I hate to imbue works of art with political balogna, but I just CAN'T be the only one who feels that this is a reference to The Orange Man Who Shant Be Named. 
 
 
 ## Game 2: "The Things We Lost in the Flood" Analysis
 
 Like *Sand,* *The Things We Lost in the Flood* has an 8-bit, 2D style of graphics - but unlike *Sand,* you can only move from left to right across the screen instead of up, down, left or right from a birds-eye view of the world. When the game starts, you get an explanation on the mysterious narrative of the game - there was a flood. Your playable character appears on an island, in the nude, and you have to drag a busted-up boat into the sea of flood waters to begin your journey.
 
 ![beginning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70165410/101650685-364c8300-3a0a-11eb-9a24-590ddae98e2c.png)
*Beginning scene at night
 
 This is such an interesting game narrative, because it's not like *Sand* where there are interactable CPU characters that talk to you and either tell you directly what's going on, or they imply it - in this game, you're forced to figure it out for yourself or wonder. Instead of interactable CPUs, as you journey across the flooded areas you find messages in bottles that are apparently written by other real players playing the game - some of the messages give you hints, or they ask the same questions that you're wondering about yourself. It's a really neat concept, I think - and it fits exceptionally well with the whole wreckage-by-flood theme of the game, with the messages giving you reminders that you're never truly alone. 
 
 Here's a cute message I found written by another player:
 ![cute letter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70165410/101650803-59773280-3a0a-11eb-8910-81049b71df41.png)

You hit TAB to write new messages - there will always be a prompt, from "Tell a story" to "What's your greatest fear" to this:
![write prompt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70165410/101650847-66942180-3a0a-11eb-8c6b-70b53a176f6a.png)

Naturally, my response:
![prompt response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70165410/101650868-6d229900-3a0a-11eb-8fdb-463377111db4.png)

As you paddle along in your slow-moving torn-up boat, you find items floating in the waters that you can pick up (other than messages in bottles), and they are upgrade items that you attach to your boat to make your boat move quicker. This aspect gives the player some feelings of hope for the future, as you move slowly through the flooded city. Sometimes, weird flying robots zoom across the sky, and once in a while they'll drop these strange items that you can pick up - I haven't quite figured out what those things are for, but they must be significant somehow. There's a lot of mystery and puzzle-solving to this game.

![radio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70165410/101650926-7ad81e80-3a0a-11eb-971d-1218e0938cb2.png)
*Here, the gun-shaped thing on the roof of this church turns out to be a radio that starts a new empty channel radio crackle sound once attached to the boat. Surprisingly, after a while, slow and beautifully melancholic guitar playing comes form the radio - but it eventually stops and is replaced by the radio crackle again. It adds a weird layer of loneliness and strange feelings of hope.

There are also these weird spider-looking bots that appear on buildings every once in a while, which you can destroy to pick up an item. It's a total mystery as to why those bots are there, and that confusion is affirmed when you pick up bottles from other players writing about that same question: "What the heck are these bots?!?" That's the sort of fun part about this game, you feel your confusion is shared and it somehow makes how lost you feel seem a little less jarring, because you see that other people are feeling the same way via bottle messages.

![killing bot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70165410/101651332-f2a64900-3a0a-11eb-8612-71d7fe555855.png)
*Killing a bot on the roof of a building - you can also see the music notes coming from the radio on my boat*

Eventually, you get to another land form where there is a strange door that looks like it should go to a parallel universe - when you interact with it, the screen fades and you end up right back at the beginning, on the island where you started the game, with your boat and all of its upgrades sitting behind the same rock where you first found it. I can't quite wrap my head around what this means - this is certainly a game for people with a lot of patience. 

Overall, I give this game a "cool concept but waiting is not my thing" rating. You come across lots of clues on billboards in the water, but they're sort of vague - and a lot of the time, nothing happens when you follow the prompts. And if something does happen, it's not obvious enough for the player to feel like they've solved anything - so there's a definite lack of player gratification in this game. The settings are gorgeous, though - and the messages from other players is absolutely my favorite part of this game.
