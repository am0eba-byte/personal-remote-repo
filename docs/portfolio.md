# My Digital Projects (so far)

## Adobe Softwares

### Premiere Pro

My very first (and very obviously beginner-quality) **Adobe Premiere Pro** digital short film project:

Produced for *ART 168 Digital Art* in Fall 2020 semester

**Description:** As an introduction to the vast and magical functions that Adobe Premiere Pro gives to filmmakers, this project was meant to display the basics of cinematic grammar, video formatting, basic effects, clip transitions, audio importing and editing, and other displays of basic film editing. This digital short depicts a little look into what I see every day living in a small town in the U.S. of A.
