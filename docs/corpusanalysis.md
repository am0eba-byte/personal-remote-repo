# Corpus Analysis Comparisons and Reflection

For DIGIT 100's Corpus Analysis assignment, I decided to compare all of my Hypothes.is annotations with the entire class's annotations using Voyant Tools
and Antconc. I had to do some clean-up of both of the text files in oXygen so that all the hyperlink/image location garbeldegook wouldn't make my word
frequency comparisons all wonky. I decided to run each file through Voyant first, since I think Voyant makes the data super easy to read and understand
(and it just straight-up looks nicer than Antconc!). 

### My Annotations' Voyant Word Cloud and Data

### The Whole Class's Annotations Word Cloud and Data

The first thing that stands out straight away with these word clouds is the fact that both my own and the whole class's tendency was to use the word 
"people" a whole lot! It comes up as the most frequently used with both text sets, with my frequency count at 21 and the class's at 97. So actually,
since my annotations are included in the whole class's, my frequent use of the word "people" certainly contributed in a large part to the overall
class's frequency. Another word-frequency similarity pops out in the size of the word "think" in both word clouds. I used it 11 times in my annotations,
and the whole class used it 60 times. As you'll notice in the Antconc analysis, that high frequency of the word "think" is probably 
within the terms "I think" or "I don't think," which is likely a result of both my and the class's affinity for including personal opinions or 
thought processes in our annotations - which is good, because that means at least some of the articles got us thinking and wanting to express it! One
more similar big-word in both Voyant word clouds was the word "like" - and I'm guessing that was because of our tendency to compare things in the 
articles with something else we thought of, or trying to describe some information in the article with a simile. 

A big difference in these word clouds was the use of the word "time." It seems I used that word far more frequently than the class did, proportionally
speaking. That might be because I definitely annotated a whole lot on Warsame's "The Vast Conspiracy of Memory," which references time and moments
a lot. Likewise, the word "technology" appears more frequently in the whole class's annotations than mine - I couldn't give you a solid reason for that,
but if I had to guess, maybe it's because the rest of the class tended to annotate things that were related to technology somehow more often than I did.

### My Annotations' Antconc N-Grams

### The Class's Antconc N-Grams

In the Antconc program, I found some similarities between the two sets of annotations in term usage within the n-grams that very highly correlate
with my findings from the Voyant clouds. One of the most frequent terms included people; "people who" was found 8 times in my annotations, and the term
"people who are" was found in the class's annotations 7 times - mine being one of them. This showed that the class had a tendency to place "are" after
"people who" much more than I did - while I tended to use a variety of different verbs aside from "are." This reflects the gigantic "people" that occurred
within both mine and the class's Voyant word cloud. I also noticed using KWIC that those phrases tended to be used in a number of different articles, so 
our use of phrases to describe people were pretty universal throughout the subjects we were annotating on. 

Another frequent n-gram included the word "think": I used "I think" 5 times, and the class used "I think that" 9 times, and "I don't think" 4 times, 
excluding my own use. Again, this is very reflective of the Word Clouds; and my hypothesis was proven correct *ba dum tss*, phrases containing
"think" were indeed used in a variety of contexts to supplement our annotations with our conjectures on certain bits of information in the articles.

One of the few differences between my N-Grams and the class's was that, apparantly, I like to talk about fear. The term "fear of" occurred in my 
annotations 4 times, and they tended to be within contexts relating to humanity or anxieties. The class, on the other hand, had a much higher frequency
(proportionally speaking) of the phrases "an example of," "the fact that," and "a lot of." These were used primarily to emphasize some aspect of the
information they were annotating, or providing thorough explanations of objects within the texts. I seemed to use those phrases a lot less than the class.

One last thing I found intriguing that may be good to point out was the frequency of the n-gram "anti-white racism" which appeared in the whole class's
annotations on Antconc. I used the term twice, and the rest of the class used it 6 times, for a total of 8. This was no doubt in relation to the article
we read which defended Khalid Warsame against a British professor's offensive response to "The Vast Conspiracy of Memory" in Humanist. That article
must've really got the class going, as proven in the n-gram frequency!
